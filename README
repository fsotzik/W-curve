Public versions of W-curve code and data used in published papers
and presentations.

Please see publicatons for specific URI's used to referenced 
materials (these will include branches). Otherwise feel free
to wander through the repository. The "master" branch will
always have a current, stable version of the code. 

Note: The tests are designed to run in reasonable time for 
most situations. They test whether the code runs or suffers
from rounding errors. For longer tests or benchmarks define
EXPENSIVE_TESTS to run with longer random DNA strings or 
to run tests that otherwise take too long. Some of the
tests in WCurve/02-Compare are more torture-tests than 
code validation and are likely to fail at the edges.
